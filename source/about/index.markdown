<p><strong>This blog, Heteroscadasticity, is where I am experimenting with the <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> blogging framework. The content here duplicates that in my blog the <a href="y8s.org/blog">Null Hypothesis</a>.</strong></p>

<p>This blog is a tool to capture hypotheses about shiny things that catch my eye. It will, inshaâ€™allah, consolidate and make more concrete the ephemera that flits through my head during the day and promptly evaporates.</p>

<p>Constructive feedback will always be welcome, but &#8230; as an inveterate nitpicker and quibbler I am perhaps overly sensitive to displays of the same in others. I am at least one particular instance confirming the general hypothesis that the flaws we most detest in others are our own.</p>
