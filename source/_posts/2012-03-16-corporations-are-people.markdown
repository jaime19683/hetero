<p>I was never very likely to vote for Mitt Romney but I never thought I would look to Ron Paul for a cogent response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interviewer Question: &#8220;Real quick question for you… What did you make of Mitt Romney’s statement that corporations are people yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ron Paul Answer: &#8220;Well obviously, they are not. People are individuals, they’re not group and they are not companies. Individuals have rights, they’re not collective. You can’t duck that you know that, so individuals should be responsible for corporations, and they shouldn’t be a new creature so-to-speak. The rights and obligations should be always be back to the individual.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#8217;s right. At the end of the day individual human beings are the agents that make choices, take actions, and are responsible &#8230; in corporations, unions, public interest groups, political parties, and the government. When we obscure this we run the danger that people will feel insulated from responsibility from their actions. This way danger lies.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://movetoamend.org/">Move to Amend</a> group is proposing a <a href="http://movetoamend.org/amendment">constitutional amendment</a> to address this issue in the campaign funding context. While I don&#8217;t think the constitutional amendment approach will succeed I don&#8217;t have an alternative and this windmill needs tilting.</p>
